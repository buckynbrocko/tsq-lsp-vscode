# tsq-lsp-vscode

This project's purpose is primarilly providing an oppurtunity to familiarize myself with both the LSP protocol as well as VSCode extension development.

At some point I'll work on bundling and publishing for use with VSCode/VSCodium et al, but not today. If that still hasn't happened yet consider [ts_query_ls][ts_query_ls] either in the interim or indefinitely.
